# Steveâ€™s PDF Libraries

This repository contains code for reading and writing PDF files, as needed for
various other projects of mine.

Package `pdfstruct` is the base package.  It contains methods for opening an
existing PDF file, traversing its structure, and making updates to it.

Package `pdfform` is a layer on top of `pdfstruct` that particularly knows how
to deal with interactive forms in PDF files.  It can fetch the form fields and
their values, and update them.

Package `pdfinspect` is a command line tool to inspect the contents of a PDF
file.
